The group, spearheaded by artists Charles Melvin, Cozy, Pink Noise Ordinance, and Xei the Ghost, is a consortium as diverse as their monikers. From their shared Lincoln Heights home, they are expanding the periphery of music-making one aberrant beat at a time.<br/><br/>Their single, 'Blunt Hopes', featured on Kutmah's compilation, Worldwide Family Volume 2, is such a heady fusion of sounds that classifying it as any one genre would be misrepresentative of El Super's work. The track is a clear composite of divergent, yet compatible, minds. Underneath Charles Melvin's transgressive lyrics, a deep bass is suppressed by a glitchy beat, amplified, in the last half of the song, by Cozy's ethereal vocals. The alluring video, directed by Gerry Maravilla, only enhances the track. <br/><br/>The most promising part of El Super though, is that they are as successful solo as in collaboration. The members, each given to a specific wont, are experts in their personal sound. Pink Noise Ordinance may be the future of dance with motley anime remixes. Charles Melvin perfects a California drawl in 'King Supa.' You'll be touching yourself before the end of Cozy's 'Come'ere' and Xei the Ghost, unrivaled in his midwestern spit, you must hear for yourself. <br/><br/>El Super's heterogenous music won't stay underground for long.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://www.inverted-audio.com/kutmah-presents-worldwide-family-vol-2/' target='_blank'>Inverted Audio</a>",

In this incarnation The Bug consisted of Kevin Martin and DJ Vadim was in more of a downtempo and trip-hop vein.<br/><br/>From 2001-2004 The Bug collaborated with UK reggae soundsystem veteran The Rootsman on a number of limited edition 7-Inch singles, released on the Razor X label. These releases were characterised by their harsh, aggressive nature both musically and vocally (vocal artists including Jamaican MCs such as He-Man and Wayne Lonesome).<br/><br/>The Bug's second album, Pressure was released on Rephlex Records in 2003. It included a number of more ambient, dub-influenced tracks alongside the ragga-tinged onslaughts.<br/><br/>The Razor X singles were compiled on the Killing Sound album (along with newer material) which was released by Rephlex in 2006.<br/><br/>Bug projects have included collaborations with a number of singers and MCs including Cutty Ranks, Flow Dan, Warrior Queen and Ras B. In 2005 he collaborated with Mark Stewart and Keith Levene and has released records on Rephlex, Tigerbeat6 and Klien Records. The Bug produced some radio sessions, including a clash with Soundmurderer on John Peel and a 2006 Breezeblock session with 10 MCs.<br/><br/>In 2006, The Bug launched a monthly London-based reggae club night entitled BASH, in collaboration with dubstep producer Loefah. 2008 saw the release of London Zoo, the third full release from the project, to critical acclaim.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Martin_(British_musician)#The_Bug' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>",

As the initial disbelief at how young he was, his love of heart aching RnB, what he looked like and who he used to record as sink further and further back into the pages of Google the initial hype will be succeeded by better and better music, some limited run white labels, a touring analogue live show and a stronger vision from an artist who never really cared bout being the man of the moment. Jacques Greene is here for the long run. This plan was a long time coming.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://thisisluckyme.com/music/jacques-greene/' target='_blank'>Lucky Me</a>",

	info:"We are a record label and extended family of artists founded in Scotland by Mike Slott, Dominic Flannigan, Martyn Flyn & Hudson Mohawke. The label stays is at the fore of new electronic music and rank over 20 leading musicians and designers all over the world. Some of us are beautiful. Others are ugly. Let us tell you how it all started…<br/><br/>LuckyMe Records began as a 100 capacity club held in a vegan rock venue in Glasgow. We were a hip hop group who increasingly became influenced by the techno, house, jazz and post-rock. On the auspicious date 07.07.07 in the Chinese year of the Golden Hog we started operating as the artist collective you see here today.<br/><br/>Ours is another real D.I.Y story of artists and young-ass fake business men. All our friends are the product, industry and workforce behind LuckyMe. Arguably more than ever before the UK sits at the epicentre of emerging dance music and we claim our corner, bringing a unique set of influences and innovative artists to the table. We helped carve the first releases and column inches for this new Glasgow scene but where this goes from here is every bit as exciting. We now work with a global roster with full-time / no-day-job / no-rich-relatives directors based in London, Edinburgh & New York. It's a good feeling.<br/><br/>So with ever-renewing appreciation, we continue to release our favourite music, shows or artwork for people to eat up in this far too cynical world.<br/><br/>From<a href='http://thisisluckyme.com/who-are-luckyme/' target='_blank'>Lucky Me</a>",

Vocalist and bassist Ekhi Lopetegi, guitarist Tomas Palomo, keyboardist Unai Lazcano, and drummer Igor Escudeo wanted to explore their mutual interests, from the local punk rock scene to electronic music. The quartet, who named the band after the iconic time machine featured in the Back to the Future series, released an EP and two studio albums between 2004 and 2006 to little mainstream success. In 2007, Palomo left the band and was replaced by Guillermo Astrain. Delorean subsequently relocated to Barcelona, veering towards more computer-based composition and production. Tiring of the relative low quality of the local dance music scene, the band members created their own eclectic club night, Desparrame, in which they continued the evolution of their music. Remixes for the likes of The xx, Cold Cave, and Franz Ferdinand gave Delorean exposure in the music press.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delorean_(band)' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>",

Kompakt itself was formally founded in 1998, combining several existing labels, the record store and distributor and also event organizing activities.<br/><br/>According to Grooves magazine, 'Kompakt's chief aesthetic objective has always been the perfect marriage of ambient texture and linear 4x4 structure—blending deep, granular sound design with the 4-bar rhythmic intensity and patterning that makes house and techno so club-effective'.Kompakt has been noted for releases enriching abstract techno tracks with pop elements such as vocals - Mayer has stated that 'We grew up with pop music and really like traces of pop in techno music. This is probably Kompakt's biggest strength-- that we can detect these pop traces and give them a home'. British music critic Simon Reynolds has characterized Kompakt as the 'label that's contributed more than any other to Germany's dominance of electronic dance music this decade [the 2000s]'.<br/><br/>From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompakt' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>",

It is known for mostly releasing minimal techno, glitch music and other experimental electronic music.<br/><br/>In early 2004, Mille Plateaux parent company Force Inc. Music Works went bankrupt due to the collapse of Germany's main independent music distributor, EFA-Medien. Mille Plateaux and other Force Inc. Music Works owned labels were folded at that time. The label was revived briefly in late 2004 under the name MillePlateauxMedia, with 4 releases. In 2005, two releases were made by RAI STREUBEL MUSIC S.L. on the label Supralinear with the note 'by Mille Plateaux'.<br/><br/>Mille Plateaux relaunched its activities on May 7, 2010, with three new albums.<br/><br/>The name Mille Plateaux was taken from Mille Plateaux, a philosophy book by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, published in 1980.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Plateaux' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>"	,

	info:"Martin Stimming was born in Giessen, Germany. Playing various instruments like violin, piano and drums when he was 10 years, discovering electronic music 5 years after. DJ Krush and Grooverider provided his introduction into this new electronic sound dimension. About a year later he came upon techno. At this time he was living in Butzbach, a small town near Frankfurt – influenced very much from Chris Liebing and Sven Vaeth, starting to djing and buying vinyl. He soon realized that for him making music was more fullfilling than 'just' playing a groove, or mixing a record, so he started to take his production seriously and moved to Hamburg to attend SAE (School of Audio Engineering). Music had become the most important thing in his life. For 2 years, he was the producer part of the Gebrueder Ton, and in this time he befriended Diynamic (a record label from Solomun and Adriano). Stimming's debut on Diynamic was Diynamic 006 Feuervogel EP, which he produces together with Solomun. The man just never seems to sleep. Releasing and remixing all over, right now he is definitely in demand, and its obvious to all why. Everything he touches turns to gold and once again with have a couple of nuggets here for you today. There is plenty more to come, from this talented young producer.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://www.beatport.com/artist/stimming/37642' target='_blank'>Beatport</a>"	,

Subsequent songs have appeared on a number of television shows.<br/><br/>The duo's first tour took place in 2006, along with the release of their critically acclaimed album Silent Shout.

The Internet in many ways has been 'the great equalizer' for both artists and music fans giving us all new opportunities to release, buy and receive music. Artists are able to reach new listeners with ease, while interested fans have plenty of avenues to express their own voices online and discover something new. And while people aren't buying music at the stores at the same rate as in the past, they certainly are willing to support the people that make art they love. Fans still want something tangible and by evidence of current blog/Twitter culture, are seeming just as interested in the story and method as they are in the final product.<br/><br/>Thus leads way to the introduction of a new type of label called FoF Music (Friends of Friends), the name itself is the driving force behind the label and website, referring to the most effective way (yet traditional way!) people learn about new music: through Friends! The hope is to help re-invent how music is released in a way that is not only more involving for the artist (A&R, artwork, marketing) but more importantly truly enticing for the fans. We want to create releases that are inspiring for artists and fans alike; with the intention to create a product that is not a useless plastic memory holder but rather is worth the hard earned money spent to create and purchase.<br/><br/>Be on the lookout for the goodies to come via FoF Music!",

	info:"Andrew Field-Pickering's work as Maxmillion Dunbar has ping-ponged through electronic music's vast network of subgenres, hitting zonked-out, late-night house, jumping into rough-edged lo-fi, experimental work and beyond. His latest album, House of Woo (out Feb. 19th on RVNG), is his most gorgeous and full-bodied yet. Field-Pickering's got a massive record collection, and his genuine enthusiasm for electronic music (and really, music as a whole) is unmatched. This Aurora Halal-directed video for 'Loving the Drift' captures that vibe in its all colorful glory, but it's the song that really stands out, with its endless synth washes glide over clipped hi-hats and stuttered bass. It's not minimal, but Field-Pickering never over does it; he lets the track breathe naturally, with a life of its own.<br/><br/>From <a href='http://www.thefader.com/2013/02/07/video-maxmillion-dunbar-loving-the-drift/' target='_blank'>The Fader</a>",

New artists compete with each other so brutally for press and attention these days. Jacques simply toured, performed, kept in the studio. And with Another Girl all the hype sort of came to him. He came out the gate with two strong records for us and nothing short of an anthem on the Night Slugs Allstars CD and grew like real artists should, with steady high performing releases. As the initial disbelief at how young he was, his love of heart aching RnB, what he looked like and who he used to record as sink further and further back into the pages of Google the initial hype will be succeeded by better and better music, some limited run white labels, a touring analogue live show and a stronger vision from an artist who never really cared bout being the man of the moment. Jacques Greene is here for the long run. This plan was a long time coming.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://thisisluckyme.com/music/jacques-greene/' target='_blank'>Lucky Me</a>",

With an arsenal of records, they started crafting songs with disco boogie samples and manipulating the songs with a strong instrumental hip-hop sensibility. This crosses over to their live performances and the duo has developed a tight and interactive partnership through their controllers and softwares. 'Controlism' as the boys like to term it.
